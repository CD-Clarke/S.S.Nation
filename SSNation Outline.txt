===S.S.Nation Game Pitch===
Team-based action game a-la Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Primary gimmicks are that you play with a party of up to 4 characters and can freely tag between them in combos, and the Mod button. 
'Hunters' fly on the S.S. Nation, a starship that takes them to various [planets/dimensions/planes of existence] to fight things. Work as a team.

===Button layout [DS4]===

R1 - Lock on
R2 - Attack A + Attack B
L1 - Mod Button {Hold to change buttons to perform the action after the slash}
L2 - Guard

Cross - Jump/Unique movement
Square - Attack A/Call first member for assist
Triangle - Attack B/Call second member for assist
Circle - Unique Attack/Call third member for assist

D-Pad - Tag into a team member, or taunt on down

Left Stick - Movement
Right Stick - Camera

===Gameplay===

Team of 1-4 characters beating up enemies. Need a premise that gives an opportunity for lots of different areas/enemies
Can't use a full team of 4 right away
Add/unlock more characters with more play/unlock conditions (MAKE IMPORTANT BOSS PLAYABLE BY SURVIVING WITHOUT HITTING HIM FOR 2 MINUTES)
Separate health bars for each character, if defeated they're knocked out until the next mission/revival item is used

Jumps have invincibility, give some characters invincibile moves?

Each different character will have similar but distinct combo strings; few unique combinations to reduce the need for memorization
Therefore, attack strings (AABA) will often be shared between characters with SIMILAR effects, similar to Bayonetta where different weapons would share attack strings
Obvious exception is combos using a characers unique attack

Attack strings can be cancelled into directional attacks (think DMC moves where you lock on and do attack+direction), jumps, unique movements, guard, tags and assist calls
Cancelling to a tag means that the currently executing attack will finish its animation even while the new character is free to move, increasing combo ability

Calling an assist causes the called character to perform one move/string that the player programs in the menu, same vein as programming assists in Skullgirls
Called character can be hurt, knocks them out of the assist
Cancelling to an assist call should interrupt the currently execting move with a call animation
Some kind of resource associated with tags, if a tag/assist is hit, they go on a cooldown as well
