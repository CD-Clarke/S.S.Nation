===S.S.Nation Game Pitch===
Team-based action game a-la Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Primary gimmicks are that you play with a party of up to 4 characters and can freely tag between them in combos, and the Mod button. 
'Hunters' fly on the S.S. Nation, a starship that takes them to various [planets/dimensions/planes of existence] to fight things. Work as a team.

===Button layout [DS4]===

R1 - Lock on
R2 - Attack A + Attack B
L1 - Mod Button {Hold to change buttons to perform the action after the slash}
L2 - Guard

Cross - Jump/Unique movement
Square - Attack A/Call first member for assist
Triangle - Attack B/Call second member for assist
Circle - Unique Attack/Call third member for assist

D-Pad - Tag into a team member, or taunt on down

Left Stick - Movement, click to shift targets
Right Stick - Camera, click to re-centre view

===Gameplay===

DMC-style action in a 3D environment, roam the level from encounter to encounter
Mission structure - select a mission to take on from the S.S. Nation hub, fly out and do it
Team of 1-4 characters beating up enemies. Need a premise that gives an opportunity for lots of different areas/enemies
Can't use a full team of 4 right away - start off with one cool, likeable character who kicks ass and takes names and makes it look easy
Add/unlock more characters with more play/unlock conditions (MAKE IMPORTANT BOSS PLAYABLE BY SURVIVING WITHOUT HITTING HIM FOR 2 MINUTES)
Separate health bars for each character, if defeated they're knocked out until the next mission/revival item is used

Jumps have invincibility, give some characters invincibile moves?

Each different character will have similar but distinct combo strings; few unique combinations to reduce the need for memorization
Therefore, attack strings (AABA) will often be shared between characters with SIMILAR effects, similar to Bayonetta where different weapons would share attack strings
Obvious exception is combos using a characers unique attack

Attack strings can be cancelled into directional attacks (think DMC moves where you lock on and do attack+direction), jumps, unique movements, guard, tags and assist calls
Cancelling to a tag means that the currently executing attack will finish its animation even while the new character is free to move, increasing combo ability

Calling an assist causes the called character to perform one move/string that the player programs in the menu, same vein as programming assists in Skullgirls
Called character can be hurt, knocks them out of the assist
Cancelling to an assist call should interrupt the currently executing move with a call animation
Some kind of resource associated with tags, if a tag/assist is hit, they go on a cooldown as well

Definitely a Bayonetta-esque camera - fairly free to rotate, lock-on fouses the view to the locked enemy

===Presentation===

Some thought led me to want some kind of low-poly style (Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 3, Mega Man Legends, etc.). 
Low-poly allows for a few things - quicker turnaround on assets, easier to animate, allows for assets to be loaded in memory on less powerful machines, plus I just love low-poly stuff
Colourful, non-serious tone allows for crazier and more interesting character designs/worlds
Go to a world made of sweets, nintendo style, beat up biscuits etc. Next mission, fly to a volcanic wasteland plagued by demon-like monsters. You could go crazy.

===Story===

People called Hunters (Assassins? some other cool name for someone whose work involves beating up enemies) work as teams and make a living by travelling to other worlds and dimensions to kill stuff that people want dead
The player starts the game mid-mission, tutorial type thing, kills an easy boss at the end, and gets their reward, some currency to spend on moves/powerups.
Get transported back to the S.S. Nation, a spaceship that the protagonist flies around in to get to jobs
S.S. Nation acts as the player's hub - purchase new moves/power-ups here, go to job locations
Maybe major story points give the player ship upgrades that let them venture to new places?
Something to unlock early on - I REALLY want some kind of endless dungeon thing where you just get room after room of encounters to beat
NEED SOME MAJOR PLOT THREAD
